# Naval-Mine-Detector
Mine detection and classification using side scan sonar imaginary is challenging problem . As opposed to the majority of techniques, several Neural-network -based method for detection and classification of mines and mine like objects have been proposed. By using the concept of Deep learning with Neural network we predict whether object is mine or not
